# A-B-Testing
In this project, Udacity (a company which focuses on online education), likes to run an experiment and see whether or not adding a message after a clicking on the “start free trial” button in their website would have significant effects. The idea is to ask the student about the amount of free time he/she has to spend on the course. If they answer less than 5 hours per week, then a warning message shows up advising him/her that the course will require more time and they will not be successful with less than 5 hours. With this in mind, the student will still have an option to go ahead with the free trial or not. The hypothesis of this idea is that the student will be enlightened about what he/she might expect and hence, avoid frustration without significantly reducing the course enrollment. If this hypothesis is true, Udacity will manage to improve the experience of students throughout the class. In the following steps, we are going to test this hypothesis through A/B testing.
